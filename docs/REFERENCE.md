# Reference

Detailed contract for callers integrating with the MCP tools **directly**. Most users can skip
this — Claude Code consumes these envelopes for you behind the `/kimi:*` slash commands. See the
[README](../README.md) for installation and everyday use.

## Result envelopes

Every tool returns a discriminated envelope keyed by `ok`. The success shape depends on the tool:
all of `kimi_consult`/`kimi_review_changes`/`kimi_delegate` carry `summary`/`findings`/`meta`,
but the review-only `verdict`/`confidence`/`review_status`/`coverage` appear solely on
`kimi_review_changes` and the proposed `diff` only on `kimi_delegate` — consult (Q&A) carries
neither a verdict nor a diff. `review_status` distinguishes a completed review from one that never
ran the model (nothing reviewable → `not_run`/`unknown`, never a false `pass`), and `coverage`
discloses omitted untracked files, truncation, or redaction — downgrading a `pass` over partial
coverage to `unknown`. `kimi_status`,
`kimi_capabilities`, the `kimi_job_*` lifecycle tools, `kimi_dry_run`, and `kimi_delegate_dry_run`
return their own documented shapes (branch on the tool, or on `ok`/`tool`/`status`, before reading
fields). Failure is uniform: an `error` object built for machine-driven recovery, not just prose:

- `code` — a stable error code from a fixed set (e.g. `invalid_arguments`, `job_running`,
  `job_not_found`).
- `message` — human-readable detail.
- `temporary` + `retry_after_ms` — whether retrying can succeed and how long to back off
  (`retry_after_ms` is always present; `null` unless `temporary` is true).
- `repair` — `{next_step, tool, arguments, alternative}`: `next_step` is a stable SYMBOLIC
  label you branch on (e.g. `poll_job_status`, `correct_arguments`); `tool`/`arguments` name a
  tool to call to recover; `alternative` is prose fallback. Omitted only when no corrective
  path exists.
- `details` — `{field, fields, reason, allowed_values}`: `field` names a single offending input;
  `fields` (mutually exclusive with `field`; non-empty, unique) names inputs whose *combination* is
  invalid (e.g. a combined-size limit where no single input is at fault). The rejected `value` is
  deliberately never echoed (it may be a secret).
- `invalid_arguments` — set when `code` is `invalid_arguments`: a list of
  `{field, reason, allowed_values}` per offending argument; `details` mirrors the first.
- `limit_bytes`/`actual_bytes`/`candidate_roots` — size/roots context for the relevant codes.
  (`candidate_roots` accompanies `workspace_outside_roots`, which is unreachable since ADR 0005.)

Absent optional fields are omitted from the payload (no placeholder nulls), except
`retry_after_ms`. The full schema is published at the `kimi://error-envelope` resource.

Success envelopes follow the same convention inside `meta`. On a delivered
`kimi_consult`/`kimi_review_changes`/`kimi_delegate` success, optional `meta` members whose
value is null are omitted entirely — a key's **absence** means exactly what an explicit null
meant (not applicable, or not reported for this run). Read them with a null-safe accessor
(`.get`), never by testing key presence. The six required members (`cwd`, `tier`, `sandbox`,
`isolation`, `timeout_seconds`, `elapsed_ms`) are always present, and empty arrays stay empty
arrays rather than disappearing.

Everything *outside* `meta` is delivered verbatim: top-level fields keep their keys even when
null — including `kimi_delegate`'s `diff`, which is null on a run that proposed no changes — and
so does `raw_response`. The `*_async` job handle and `kimi_job_status` are **not** slimmed and
still send their nulls. The stored `result.json` also keeps the full shape; this trimming happens
on delivery, which is why a replayed job result and a fresh synchronous one look identical (see
[ADR 0002](adr/0002-omit-null-meta-on-the-wire.md) for why the rule stops at `meta`).

`kimi_capabilities` lists the error codes each tool may return (`error_codes`) as an advisory guide
— useful for planning recovery, but not a closed contract. The envelope shape is versioned by
`fingerprint`; clients can cache by it.

### Fetching schemas without the inventory

Prefer the `kimi://` resources for the full contracts.
A **resource-blind** client that cannot read them can pass `include_schemas` to `kimi_capabilities`
instead, which embeds the requested contracts in the response.

That fallback returns the whole tool inventory alongside the schema, which a client that already
cached the inventory pays for again on every fetch.
Pass **`detail="contracts"`** to omit `tool_details` and get everything else unchanged — the
schemas, `fingerprint`, `fingerprint_covers`, and the server identity fields:

- `detail="contracts"` **with** `include_schemas` — fetch a contract without re-paying for the
  inventory.
- `detail="contracts"` **alone** — a cheap `fingerprint` recheck for cache revalidation.

`tool_details` is the only field this drops; it is optional in the published schemas, so a
`contracts` response still validates against both the tool's `outputSchema` and
`kimi://capabilities-result`. Measured at `schema-62` on a representative payload, a schema
fetch falls from 28,778 to 21,456 bytes and a bare call from 11,109 to 3,787 — indicative
figures that move with the tool inventory, not a promised bound.

`detail` is a single knob: `contracts` is an alternative to `summary`/`full`, not a modifier of
them, so it carries no inventory to be verbose about.
See [ADR 0003](adr/0003-fetch-schemas-without-the-inventory.md) for why this is a `detail` mode
rather than a separate tool or a `schemas_only` flag.

Every result envelope also carries `server_version` beside `fingerprint`. The two answer different
questions and are not interchangeable:

- `fingerprint` — **contract identity**: which agent-visible surface (tool/field shapes, error
  codes, documented meaning) this result conforms to. A client cache key — bump it and a cached
  client re-fetches the contract.
- `server_version` — **release identity**: the installed `moonbridge` package version attributed
  to this result. Provenance, not a cache key — it lets a downstream consumer (an MCP error audit,
  say) scope an analysis to a release instead of guessing from timestamps. It is a *package* version,
  not a per-commit build id: an unreleased build reports the release it was cut from, so two runs
  sharing a `server_version` may still differ in code (and, if the surface moved, in `fingerprint`).

`server_version` is nullable. A **result** reply — a `done` job replaying its stored payload —
reports the `server_version` of the run that **produced** it, never the version of the server
replaying it: replaying never overwrites provenance with the replaying process's own identity. A
job result persisted before this field existed replays with `server_version` **absent** (omitted,
not backfilled), rather than being stamped with a plausible-but-wrong version.

A job in a non-`done` terminal state (`failed`, `timeout`, `cancelled`) or not found has no stored
payload to replay: the server synthesizes an error envelope for it, and that envelope's
`server_version` is the **polling** server's own version, not any producing worker's — the job
record persists no worker version, so there is nothing to preserve. A consumer reading synthesized
error envelopes (an error audit, say) must attribute `server_version` on those envelopes to whichever
server answered the poll, not to the run that failed.

**Read version fields by exact key, never by pattern.** Two tools carry version-ish keys, and they
do not name the same software. `kimi_capabilities` returns `version` and `server_version` — both
*this* server's installed package version. `kimi_status` returns `server_version` for this server
and `kimi_version` for the **Kimi CLI** — the external binary this server shells out to (its
companion `version_supported` is a boolean about that CLI, not about this server). Match the exact
key you mean; pattern-matching key names containing "version" risks reading the wrong software's
version.

Secret-looking values are redacted from every free-text surface before it leaves the plugin —
`summary`, `findings`/`questions`/`assumptions`/`next_steps`, and `raw_response.text` — in addition
to gathered diffs. Inline matches are replaced with `[redacted: secret value]` when nothing about
the match's neighboring characters gives an affirmative sign it stopped short — not a claim the
replaced span is provably complete, which this best-effort mechanism cannot make — or with
`[redacted: possibly partial secret value]` when it finds such a sign: a trailing character the
matched text's own alphabet could not have produced (the value may continue past the marker), or a
leading character that could continue the same token (the match may have started mid-token).
Neither marker is a guarantee in either direction: a free-form secret can contain almost any
character, so the checks deliberately do not flag every unusual neighbor — doing so would fire on
nearly every redaction and stop being a useful signal. This is **best-effort
defense-in-depth, not a guarantee**: it covers content the plugin itself surfaces, not whatever Kimi
may read or act on during a run. The schema is unchanged; the inline marker is the only signal.

For a gathered diff specifically, `kimi_review_changes`/`kimi_dry_run`'s `coverage.redaction`
breaks the `redacted` omission reason down further when a structured breakdown is available:
`withheld_paths` names files whose hunk was dropped whole, `masked_paths` names files sent with
inline values replaced, and `inline_masks` counts the markers actually emitted. The reason CAN fire
with no breakdown — a legacy-shaped producer, or a disclosure dropped entirely by byte-cap
truncation — but `redaction` is never non-null without the reason also firing (enforced).
`meta.redacted_paths` stays the flat, backward-compatible union of both path lists.

### Detail levels

`kimi_consult`, `kimi_review_changes`, `kimi_delegate`, and async result retrieval
(`kimi_job_result`, `kimi_job_consume_result`) take a `detail` parameter:

- `detail="summary"` (**default**) — omits the raw model text (`raw_response.text`), which usually
  duplicates content already in `summary`/`findings`/`diff`. The structured fields remain
  authoritative, and the parser shape is unchanged: `raw_response` is still present with `text` set to
  `null` (its `session_id`/`model` — also in `meta` — are kept).
- `detail="full"` — includes the complete raw model output for diagnostics.

At the MCP call boundary an unrecognized value is rejected as `invalid_arguments` before the tool
handler runs, with `details.allowed_values` listing the accepted values. For async work the worker
always stores the full envelope, so a later `kimi_job_result(..., detail="full")` can still recover
the raw text.

## Idempotency

The six spend-committing tools — `kimi_consult`, `kimi_review_changes`, `kimi_delegate` and their
`_async` variants — take an optional `idempotency_key`. Reusing a key on the **same tool** with the
same arguments replays the existing run instead of starting (and paying for) a duplicate Kimi call:
a sync call reattaches to the in-flight run and returns its result; an `_async` call returns the same
`job_id`. The key is scoped to the concrete tool — the sync and `_async` variants are different tools
and never share a key's run. [ADR 0001](adr/0001-keep-sync-and-async-tools-separate.md) explains why
they are separate tools. Reuse with different arguments (including a different `timeout_seconds`)
is refused with `idempotency_conflict`; a key whose prior result was already consumed/evicted is
`idempotency_result_unavailable`; a still-publishing reservation is `idempotency_in_progress`
(retryable). Omit the key for the prior no-dedup behavior.

- `meta.idempotency_replayed` — `true` only on a replayed response, marking that no new Kimi spend
  occurred; omitted otherwise.
- `meta.job_kind` — set on a lifecycle (`kimi_job_*`) error envelope when it resolved an existing
  job record, naming that job's kind (e.g. `kimi_delegate`); omitted for not-found/pre-lookup errors.

## Background jobs

The `kimi_job_*` lifecycle tools manage detached runs started by the `_async` tools (and the job
records that sync runs also create). Operational semantics:

- **Backoff.** Every polling response carries `poll_after_ms`; honor it rather than polling in a
  tight loop. It grows with a running job's elapsed runtime (bounded), so you back off
  automatically on long runs.
- **Deadline.** A job is bounded by a wall-clock cap (`MOONBRIDGE_JOB_MAX_SECONDS`); a poll
  past the deadline reaps the job.
- **Retention.** Results are retained `ttl_seconds` **after** a job completes, so `expires_at` is
  `null` while it runs and is set once it finishes. Records are also evicted oldest-terminal-first
  past a per-workspace count cap (`MOONBRIDGE_JOB_MAX_COUNT`).
- **`server_version` provenance.** Only a *replayed* payload carries the producing run's version;
  every freshly built envelope carries the responding server's. For a `done` job, a
  `kimi_job_result`/`kimi_job_consume_result` reply replays the stored payload and carries the
  `server_version` of the run that *produced* it, not the version of the server currently serving the
  poll — replaying never re-stamps provenance. A result from a job persisted before this field existed
  replays with `server_version` absent. Everything else is freshly constructed and therefore reports
  the *responding* server: `kimi_job_status`, `kimi_job_list`, and a successful `kimi_job_cancel`,
  plus the synthesized error envelope for a job in another terminal state (`failed`, `timeout`,
  `cancelled`) or not found — those have no stored payload to preserve. See Result envelopes above.

## Rate-limit reporting

`kimi_status` reports `rate_limit.status` as `unavailable`, always. kimi exposes no
quota-read channel — there is no equivalent of an app-server quota request — and its provider is
user-configured, so the server has nothing authoritative to report and does not guess. This is not
a failure state; judge spend from the size of the task instead, and handle a provider-side
`kimi_rate_limited` error if one comes back.


## Workspace selection

When calling the MCP tools directly, pass `workspace_root` as an absolute path to the repository you
want Kimi to inspect or edit. **Pass it.** As of ADR 0005 the server can no longer read MCP roots at
all, so a call that omits `workspace_root` falls back to the server's own launch directory and
returns `meta.workspace_warning` — there is no client-supplied root left to save it.

`meta.roots_source` reports what the MCP-roots probe saw. It is now always `unsupported`: MCP SDK v2
removed the server-to-client `roots/list` request on every protocol era, so no probe runs. The three
older values — `client`, `not_negotiated`, `probe_failed` — remain in the published value set so a
stored envelope still validates against it, but this server no longer emits them. It does **not** say
where the workspace came from: `workspace_source` answers that, and it is now either `param` (you
passed `workspace_root`) or `cwd` (you did not). The `roots` value of `workspace_source`, the
`workspace_outside_roots` error code, and its `candidate_roots` detail are likewise still advertised
but unreachable, for the same reason.

On a **successful** preview, `kimi_dry_run` and `kimi_delegate_dry_run` expose the same value as a
**top-level** `roots_source` rather than under `meta`; when their error envelopes report it at all it
sits under `meta` like every other tool, and an argument rejected at the call boundary carries none
because the value is stamped after that boundary (no probe runs at all now — see above). Which run it describes depends on the envelope: a delivered
`kimi_consult`/`kimi_review_changes`/`kimi_delegate` result — returned synchronously or fetched
later via `kimi_job_result`/`kimi_job_consume_result` — reports the **originating** run, like
`tier`, while an `*_async` job handle (including an idempotency replay handle), a dry-run preview,
and an error a `kimi_job_*` call generates instead of delivering a stored result each report the
**current** call. So a replay handle and the result later fetched for that same job may legitimately
differ. A missing key means only that the value was not reported (see
[Result envelopes](#result-envelopes) for the null-omission rule) — never infer a run's age or
identity from its absence. The exhaustive per-envelope matrix ships with the field itself at
`kimi://result-meta`.

Both dry runs also carry `deadline_advisory`: non-null when the previewed paid call's prompt size or
reasoning effort risks the synchronous deadline, naming — verbatim, so it is directly callable — the
**previewed paid tool's own** `_async` counterpart: `kimi_review_changes_async` from `kimi_dry_run`,
`kimi_delegate_async` from `kimi_delegate_dry_run`. Never the dry-run tool's own name, which has no
`_async` variant (there is no `kimi_dry_run_async`) — an earlier draft of this field used a generic
"this tool's `_async` variant" phrase that, read from the dry-run caller's own perspective, pointed at
that nonexistent tool; a Kimi review caught it before release. It is a hint, not a refusal —
`would_call_model` and every other field are unaffected — and it is unconditionally null whenever
`would_call_model` (`kimi_dry_run`) or the delegate preview's equivalent would-call fact is false: a
call that runs no model cannot overrun a deadline it never approaches. `kimi_consult` has no dry-run
preview at all; for a high-effort or broad repo-grounded consult, prefer `kimi_consult_async` directly.

The job-lifecycle tools (`kimi_job_status`, `kimi_job_list`, `kimi_job_cancel`) carry the resolved
workspace on **successful** responses too — a compact `workspace` object with `cwd`,
`workspace_source` (`param`/`roots`/`cwd` — `roots` unreachable since ADR 0005), and
`workspace_warning` (set on a cwd fallback). Because
jobs are scoped per workspace, this lets you confirm which repository a poll or list targeted instead
of mistaking a wrong-workspace lookup for an empty list or `job_not_found`. (Error responses already
carry the same context via `meta`.)

Review and delegate operations need a git repository. `kimi_delegate` also requires at least one
commit so it can create the temporary worktree.
