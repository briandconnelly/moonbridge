"""Canonical snapshot of the DELIVERED (wire) success-envelope surface (issue #334).

The sibling ``result_format_snapshot`` pins what a worker writes to ``result.json``;
this pins what a caller actually receives, which since #334 is a different shape: the
delivery chokepoint drops ``meta``'s null-valued keys. Neither existing guard can see
that change — the manifest snapshot captures schemas (unmoved by a serializer change)
and the result-format snapshot renders only through ``dump_success``/``serialize_error``
(deliberately untouched here, so ``RESULT_FORMAT`` must NOT move). Without this fixture
the omission would ship with no reviewable evidence of exactly which keys disappeared.

Both detail levels are rendered because they are separate wire shapes: ``summary`` nulls
``raw_response.text`` before slimming runs, and that null is retained (only ``meta``
sheds keys), so the fixture also pins ``apply_detail``'s guarantee against a future
broadening of the omission rule.

Rendered by driving the REAL chokepoint, ``server._finished_job_envelope``, rather than
by re-applying its steps here. Re-implementing them looked equivalent and was not: the
chokepoint stamps ``meta.job_id`` before trimming, so a hand-rolled pipeline reported
``job_id`` as an omitted key when delivery never omits it, and — worse — a snapshot that
calls the shaping helpers itself stays green when the *wiring* is removed, leaving the
fixture blind to the one regression it exists to catch (Kimi review of #334).

The representative metas POPULATE their applicable optional fields (#400). They once left
every optional null, which made the fixture blind in a way that reads as coverage: a null
optional is already absent from a delivered envelope, so a regression deleting a
*populated* optional key rendered a byte-identical fixture. That blindness was repo-wide,
not local to this module — ``slim_meta`` was measurably free to destroy ``meta.model`` and
``meta.session_id`` on every delivered envelope with the whole suite green. Which fields
each envelope populates, and why three of them are populated nowhere, is documented on the
builders below.
