"""Canonical manifest of the full agent-visible MCP surface (issue #140).

Snapshotting this manifest guards ``FINGERPRINT``: any externally observable
change to the CONTRACT within a category in ``FINGERPRINT_COVERS``
(``schemas.py``) moves the snapshot. Release identity does not — the
release-variable fields excluded below are absent from the snapshot by design,
so an ordinary release leaves it byte-identical (#337). That tuple is the
authority — do not re-list its categories here or anywhere else, or the copy
drifts as the tuple grows. This is an *acknowledgment*
guard: the snapshot test fails on any covered change so it cannot ship
unreviewed, and its message directs the author to bump ``FINGERPRINT``; it does
not mechanically force the integer bump (the snapshot and ``FINGERPRINT`` are
independently editable). The rules for both questions — bump? breaking? — live
in ``AGENTS.md`` under Versioning.
