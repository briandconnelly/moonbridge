# Compressing the tools/list catalog (#333) shrinks these docstrings. A dropped
# egress/security guarantee is a BREAKING change (AGENTS.md § Versioning), yet the
# `"provider" in doc` check above is far too coarse to catch it: it would still pass
# after the raw-input, files-read, auto-loaded-AGENTS.md, isolation, or best-effort-
# redaction guarantees were silently deleted. This matrix locks each guarantee a
# tool's description states TODAY so compression can only make it shorter, never
# softer.
#
# Each matcher is a semantic probe over the lowercased docstring: it survives a
# reword but fails on an omission. The required set per tool is the empirically
# captured current baseline, NOT an idealized maximum — the `_async` twins
# deliberately carry a compressed subset (they reference their sync sibling), so
# requiring the full set on them would be a spurious failure. Adjust a tool's row
# only when deliberately, reviewably changing what that tool guarantees inline.
#
# The files-read disclosure: a genuine `read`/`reads`/`reading` verb adjacent (either
# order, within one sentence) to a file token, over the lowercased docstring. The `read`
# in "read-only" is excluded — that is the decoupled token that let the old, coarser
# "read" + "file"/"repo" co-occurrence pass on stray "read-only sandbox" + "repo-grounded"
# text even after the real disclosure was deleted (#345). Adjacency (not mere
# co-occurrence) is what keeps "kimi never edits files" and "repo-grounded question" from

# --- deadline advisory (#342) -----------------------------------------------
# _deadline_advisory(would_call_model, prompt_bytes, effort, timeout_seconds, async_tool)
# is the one shared helper both kimi_dry_run and kimi_delegate_dry_run call. The
# predicate is: advise iff would_call_model AND (prompt_bytes > _DEADLINE_ADVISORY_
# PROMPT_BYTES OR effort in {"high", "xhigh"}). would_call_model gates the ENTIRE
# predicate — a preview whose paid call would run no model (empty diff) must never
# advise, regardless of size or effort, or the advisory would claim a deadline risk for
# a call that never happens.
#
# Round-3 Kimi review (concerns/1, medium, verified valid): the advisory text must
# name the PREVIEWED PAID tool's own `_async` counterpart verbatim
# (kimi_review_changes_async / kimi_delegate_async) — never a generic "this tool's
# _async variant" phrase, which read from the dry-run caller's own perspective points
# at a nonexistent kimi_dry_run_async / kimi_delegate_dry_run_async. `async_tool` is
# caller-supplied precisely so the helper can't reintroduce that generic phrasing.
