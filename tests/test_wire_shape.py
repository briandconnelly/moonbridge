"""Guard: the delivered success-envelope shape is pinned (issue #334).

An acknowledgment guard in the manifest/result-format mould, covering the gap both of
those leave: a wire-only serializer change moves neither of them, so without this fixture
the set of keys a caller receives could drift with no reviewable evidence. A change here
is a change to what every client sees on every call — review the diff, then decide the
FINGERPRINT bump.
